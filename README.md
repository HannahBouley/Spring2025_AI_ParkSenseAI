The problem:
In large parking lots, finding an empty parking spot can be time-consuming and frustrating for drivers. This project aims to develop an AI-powered Smart Parking Slot Detection System that uses cameras to monitor the parking lot, detect empty slots in real-time, and display the availability on a digital bulletin board at the entrance. This system will help drivers quickly locate available spots, reducing congestion and enhancing user convenience.

Train a model that can detect both full and empty parking spaces.
We will have to calculate the intersection over union.
When the value reaches a certain threshold, the parking space will be marked as occupied.
Detect a car in a video/image.
